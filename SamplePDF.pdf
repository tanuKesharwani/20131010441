Ayurvedic Medicine: An Introduction 
Ayurvedic medicine (also called Ayurveda) is one of the world’s 
oldest medical systems. It originated in India and has evolved there 
over thousands of years. In the United States, Ayurvedic medicine is 
considered complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—more 
specifically, a CAM whole medical system. Many therapies used in 
Ayurvedic medicine are also used on their own as CAM—for 
example, herbs, massage, and specialized diets. This fact sheet 
provides a general overview of Ayurvedic medicine and suggests 
sources for additional information. 
Key Points 
	 The aim of Ayurvedic medicine is to integrate and balance the 
body, mind, and spirit. This is believed to help prevent illness 
and promote wellness. 
	 Ayurvedic medicine uses a variety of products and techniques to 
cleanse the body and restore balance. Some of these products 
may be harmful if used improperly or without the direction of a 
trained practitioner. For example, some herbs can cause side 
effects or interact with conventional medicines. 
	 Before using Ayurvedic treatment, ask about the practitioner’s 
training and experience. 
	 Tell your health care providers about any complementary and 
alternative practices you use. Give them a full picture of what 
you do to manage your health. This will help ensure coordinated 
and safe care. 
Background 
Ayurvedic medicine, also called Ayurveda, originated in India 
several thousand years ago. The term “Ayurveda” combines the 
Sanskrit words ayur (life) and veda (science or knowledge). Thus, 
Ayurveda means “the science of life.” 
In the United States, Ayurvedic medicine is considered a type of 
CAM and a whole medical system. As with other such systems, it is 
based on theories of health and illness and on ways to prevent, 
manage, or treat health problems. 
Ayurvedic medicine aims to integrate and balance the body, mind, and spirit; thus, some view 
it as “holistic.” This balance is believed to lead to happiness and health, and to help prevent 
illness. Ayurvedic medicine also treats specific physical and mental health problems. A chief 
aim of Ayurvedic practices is to cleanse the body of substances that can cause disease, thus 
helping to reestablish harmony and balance. 
Ayurvedic Medicine in India 
Ayurvedic medicine, as practiced in India, is one of the oldest systems of medicine in the 
world. Many Ayurvedic practices predate written records and were handed down by word of 
mouth. Two ancient books, written in Sanskrit more than 2,000 years ago, are considered the 
main texts on Ayurvedic medicine—Caraka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita. The texts describe 
eight branches of Ayurvedic medicine: 
 Internal medicine 
 Surgery 
 Treatment of head and neck disease 
 Gynecology, obstetrics, and pediatrics 
 Toxicology 
 Psychiatry 
 Care of the elderly and rejuvenation 
 Sexual vitality. 
Ayurvedic medicine continues to be practiced in India, where nearly 80 percent of the 
population uses it exclusively or combined with conventional (Western) medicine. It is also 
practiced in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Pakistan. 
Most major cities in India have an Ayurvedic college and hospital. The Indian government 
began systematic research on Ayurvedic practices in 1969, and that work continues. 
Use in the United States 
According to the 2007 National Health Interview Survey, which included a comprehensive 
survey of CAM use by Americans, more than 200,000 U.S. adults used Ayurvedic medicine in 
the previous year. 
Underlying Concepts 
Ayurvedic medicine has several key foundations that pertain to health and disease. These 
concepts have to do with universal interconnectedness, the body’s constitution (prakriti), and 
life forces (doshas). 
Interconnectedness. Ideas about the relationships among people, their health, and the 
universe form the basis for how Ayurvedic practitioners think about problems that affect 
health. Ayurvedic medicine holds that: 
 All things in the universe (both living and nonliving) are joined together. 
 Every human being contains elements that can be found in the universe. 
2 
 
 Health will be good if one’s mind and body are in harmony, and one’s interaction with the 
universe is natural and wholesome. 
 Disease arises when a person is out of harmony with the universe. Disruptions can be 
physical, emotional, spiritual, or a combination of these. 
Constitution (prakriti). Ayurvedic medicine also has specific beliefs about the body’s 
constitution. Constitution refers to a person’s general health, the likelihood of becoming out of 
balance, and the ability to resist and recover from disease or other health problems. 
The constitution is called the prakriti. The prakriti is a person’s unique combination of physical 
and psychological characteristics and the way the body functions to maintain health. It is 
influenced by such factors as digestion and how the body deals with waste products. The 
prakriti is believed to be unchanged over a person’s lifetime. 
Life forces (doshas). Important characteristics of the prakriti are the three life forces or energies 
called doshas, which control the activities of the body. A person’s chances of developing certain 
types of diseases are thought to be related to the way doshas are balanced, the state of the 
physical body, and mental or lifestyle factors. 
Ayurvedic medicine holds the following beliefs about the three doshas: 
	 Each dosha is made up of two of five basic elements: ether (the upper regions of space), air, 
fire, water, and earth. 
	 Each dosha has a particular relationship to bodily functions and can be upset for 
different reasons. 
	 Each person has a unique combination of the three doshas, although one dosha is 
usually prominent. Doshas are constantly being formed and reformed by food, activity, 
and bodily processes. 
	 Each dosha has its own physical and psychological characteristics. 
	 An imbalance of a dosha will produce symptoms that are unique to that dosha. Imbalances 
may be caused by a person’s age, unhealthy lifestyle, or diet; too much or too little mental 
and physical exertion; the seasons; or inadequate protection from the weather, chemicals, 
or germs. 
The doshas are known by their original Sanskrit names: vata, pitta, and kapha. 
The vata dosha combines the elements ether and air. It is considered the most powerful dosha 
because it controls very basic body processes such as cell division, the heart, breathing, 
discharge of waste, and the mind. Vata can be aggravated by, for example, fear, grief, staying 
up late at night, eating dry fruit, or eating before the previous meal is digested. People with 
vata as their main dosha are thought to be especially susceptible to skin and neurological 
conditions, rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, anxiety, and insomnia. 
3 
The pitta dosha represents the elements fire and water. Pitta controls hormones and the 
digestive system. A person with a pitta imbalance may experience negative emotions such as 
anger and may have physical symptoms such as heartburn within 2 or 3 hours of eating. Pitta is 
upset by, for example, eating spicy or sour food, fatigue, or spending too much time in the sun. 
People with a predominantly pitta constitution are thought to be susceptible to hypertension, 
heart disease, infectious diseases, and digestive conditions such as Crohn’s disease. 
The kapha dosha combines the elements water and earth. Kapha helps to maintain strength 
and immunity and to control growth. An imbalance of the kapha dosha may cause nausea 
immediately after eating. Kapha is aggravated by, for example, greed, sleeping during the 
daytime, eating too many sweet foods, eating after one is full, and eating and drinking foods 
and beverages with too much salt and water (especially in the springtime). Those with a 
predominant kapha dosha are thought to be vulnerable to diabetes, cancer, obesity, and 
respiratory illnesses such as asthma. 
Treatment 
Ayurvedic treatment is tailored to each person’s constitution. Practitioners expect patients to 
be active participants because many Ayurvedic treatments require changes in diet, lifestyle, 
and habits. 
The patient’s dosha balance. Ayurvedic practitioners first determine the patient’s primary 
dosha and the balance among the three doshas by: 
 Asking about diet, behavior, lifestyle practices, recent illnesses (including reasons and 
symptoms), and resilience (ability to recover quickly from illness or setbacks) 
 Observing such physical characteristics as teeth and tongue, skin, eyes, weight, and 
overall appearance 
 Checking the patient’s urine, stool, speech and voice, and pulse (each dosha is thought to 
make a particular kind of pulse). 
Treatment practices. Ayurvedic treatment goals include eliminating impurities, reducing 
symptoms, increasing resistance to disease, and reducing worry and increasing harmony in 
the patient’s life. The practitioner uses a variety of methods to achieve these goals: 
	 Eliminating impurities. A process called panchakarma is intended to cleanse the body by 
eliminating ama. Ama is described as an undigested food that sticks to tissues, interferes 
with normal functioning of the body, and leads to disease. Panchakarma focuses on 
eliminating ama through the digestive tract and the respiratory system. Enemas, massage, 
medical oils administered in a nasal spray, and other methods may be used. 
	 Reducing symptoms. The practitioner may suggest various options, including physical 
exercises, stretching, breathing exercises, meditation, massage, lying in the sun, and 
changing the diet. The patient may take certain herbs—often with honey, to make them 
easier to digest. Sometimes diets are restricted to certain foods. Very small amounts of 
metal and mineral preparations, such as gold or iron, also may be given. 
4 
 
 
 Increasing resistance to disease. The practitioner may combine several herbs, proteins, 
minerals, and vitamins in tonics to improve digestion and increase appetite and immunity. 
These tonics are based on formulas from ancient texts. 
 Reducing worry and increasing harmony. Ayurvedic medicine emphasizes mental 
nurturing and spiritual healing. Practitioners may recommend avoiding situations that 
cause worry and using techniques that promote release of negative emotions. 
Use of plants. Ayurvedic treatments rely heavily on herbs and other plants—including oils and 
common spices. Currently, more than 600 herbal formulas and 250 single plant drugs are included 
in the “pharmacy” of Ayurvedic treatments. Historically, Ayurvedic medicine has grouped plant 
compounds into categories according to their effects (for example, healing, promoting vitality, or 
relieving pain). The compounds are described in texts issued by national medical agencies in India. 
Sometimes, botanicals are mixed with metals or other naturally occurring substances to make 
formulas prepared according to specific Ayurvedic text procedures; such preparations involve 
several herbs and herbal extracts and precise heat treatment. 
Practitioner Training and Certification 
Many practitioners study in India, where there are more than 150 undergraduate and 30 
postgraduate colleges for Ayurvedic medicine. Training can take 5 years or longer. Students 
who receive their Ayurvedic training in India can earn either a bachelor’s degree (Bachelor of 
Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery, BAMS) or doctoral degree (Doctor of Ayurvedic Medicine and 
Surgery, DAMS) there. After graduation, some Ayurvedic practitioners choose to provide 
services in the United States or other countries. 
The United States has no national standard for training or certifying Ayurvedic practitioners, 
although a few states have approved Ayurvedic schools as educational institutions. 
Concerns About Ayurvedic Medications 
Ayurvedic practice involves the use of medications that typically contain herbs, metals, 
minerals, or other materials. Health officials in India and other countries have taken steps to 
address some concerns about these medications. Concerns relate to toxicity, formulations, 
interactions, and scientific evidence. 
Toxicity. Ayurvedic medications have the potential to be toxic. Many materials used in them have 
not been thoroughly studied in either Western or Indian research. In the United States, Ayurvedic 
medications are regulated as dietary supplements. As such, they are not required to meet the 
safety and efficacy standards for conventional medicines. An NCCAM-funded study published in 
2004 found that of 70 Ayurvedic remedies purchased over-the-counter (all manufactured in South 
Asia), 14 contained lead, mercury, and/or arsenic at levels that could be harmful. Also in 2004, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 12 cases of lead poisoning occurring over 
a recent 3-year period were linked to the use of Ayurvedic medications. 
Formulations. Most Ayurvedic medications consist of combinations of herbs and other 
medicines. It can be challenging to know which components are having an effect and why. 
5 
Interactions. Whenever two or more medications are used, there is the potential for them to 
interact with each other. As a result, the effectiveness of at least one may increase or decrease 
in the body. 
Scientific evidence. Most clinical trials (i.e., studies in people) of Ayurvedic approaches have 
been small, had problems with research designs, lacked appropriate control groups, or had 
other issues that affected how meaningful the results were. Therefore, scientific evidence for 
the effectiveness of Ayurvedic practices varies, and more rigorous research is needed to 
determine which practices are safe and effective. 
Other Points To Consider About Using Ayurvedic Medicine 
	 Tell your health care providers about any complementary and alternative practices you 
use, including Ayurvedic medicine. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your 
health. This will help to ensure coordinated and safe care. For tips about talking with your 
health care providers about CAM, see NCCAM’s Time to Talk campaign at 
nccam.nih.gov/timetotalk/. 
	 Women who are pregnant or nursing, or people who are thinking of using Ayurvedic 
therapy to treat a child, should be especially sure to consult their health care provider. 
	 It is important to make sure that any diagnosis of a disease or condition has been made by 
a provider who has substantial conventional medical training and experience with 
managing that disease or condition. 
	 Proven conventional treatments should not be replaced with an unproven CAM treatment. 
	 It is better to use Ayurvedic remedies under the supervision of an Ayurvedic medicine 
practitioner than to try to treat yourself. 
	 Before using Ayurvedic treatment, ask about the practitioner’s training and experience. 
	 Find out whether any rigorous scientific studies have been done on the therapies in which 
you are interested. 
NCCAM-Funded Research 
Examples of NCCAM-supported research on therapies used in Ayurvedic medicine include 
studies of: 
 Herbal therapies, including curcuminoids (substances found in turmeric), used for 
cardiovascular conditions
